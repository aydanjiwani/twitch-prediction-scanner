# twitch-prediction-scanner
 Simple test of twitch prediction api websocket. Since there's no given endpoint for reading predictions on channels that aren't yours, had to play around with pubsub topics.
 Authorize then enter channel name. 

To run locally, add an environment variable clientID with your twitch API clientID. clone the repo and then run node app.js
