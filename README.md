# twitch-prediction-scanner
 Simple test of twitch prediction api websocket. Since there's no given endpoint for reading predictions on channels that aren't yours, had to play around with pubsub topics.
 Authorize then enter channel name. 
 Note: to run locally, host a server at localhost 8000, for example with
 the npm command http-server -p 8000
